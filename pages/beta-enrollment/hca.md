# Try out the new updates to our VA health care application

<div itemprop="description"  class="va-introtext">

We invite you to help us test the beta version of our newly updated online VA health care application.

</div>

### What’s a beta version?

A beta version is a newly updated version of a tool that we’re testing to make sure it works the way it should before we give all VA.gov users access to it. Your feedback will help us make the tool better for all Veterans.

### What will happen when I try the new version of the tool?

We'll first ask you to sign in to VA.gov. You can sign in with your DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me username and password. If you don't have any of these accounts, you can create an ID.me account at any time.

Once you're signed in, we'll ask you to review some of the new application updates to make sure they're working with your account. This won't change or affect your current VA health care enrollment status in any way. And you won't need to submit an application as part of this testing.
