<span id="medications"></span>
<h2>Medication copay rates</h2>

<h3>If you’re in priority group 1</h3>
You won’t pay a copay for any medications. 

**Note:** You may be in priority group 1 if we've rated your service-connected disability at 50% or more disabling, if we've determined that you can't work because of your service-connected disability (called unemployable), or if you've received the Medal of Honor. <br>
[Learn more about priority groups](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/resources/publications/hbco/hbco_enrollment_eligibility.asp)

<h3>If you’re in priority groups 2 through 8</h3>
<b>You'll pay a copay for:</b>
- Medications your health care provider prescribes to treat non-service-connected conditions, **and**
- Over-the-counter medications (like aspirin, cough syrup, or vitamins) that you get from a VA pharmacy. You may want to consider buying your over-the-counter medications on your own.

**Note:** The cost for any medications you receive while staying in a VA or other approved hospital or health facility are covered by your inpatient care copay.

The amount you’ll pay for these medications will depend on the “tier” of the medication and the amount of medication you’re getting, which we determine by days of supply. Once you’ve paid $700 in medication copays within a calendar year (January 1 to December 31), you won’t have to pay any more that year—even if you still get more medications. This is called a copay cap.

<h4>2019 outpatient medication copay amounts</h4>
| Outpatient medication tier | 1-30 day supply | 31-60 day supply | 61-90 day supply |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| <b>Tier 1</b><br> (preferred generic prescription medicines)        | $5                | $10                | $15                |
| <b>Tier 2</b><br> (non-preferred generic prescription medicines and some over-the-counter medicines)        | $8                | $16                | $24                |
| <b>Tier 3</b><br> (brand-name prescription medicines)        | $11                | $22                | $33                |

<b>If you have a service-connected rating of 40% or less and your income falls at or below the national income limits for receiving free medications,</b> you may want to provide your income information to us to determine if you qualify for free medications. <br>
