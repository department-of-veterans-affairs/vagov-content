<div itemprop="description" class="va-introtext">
When you choose to file a Supplemental Claim, you’re adding new evidence that’s relevant to your case or identifying new evidence for review. A reviewer will determine whether the new evidence changes the decision.
</div>

<span class="heading-level-3" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"><i class="far fa-copy"></i></span> You must add evidence VA didn’t have before that’s relevant to your case.

<div class="feature" markdown="0">

### Can I file a Supplemental Claim?

You can file a Supplemental Claim within <b>1 year</b> of a decision if you have new evidence, unless one of these rare situations applies to you. You have a: <br>
[Fiduciary claim](/decision-reviews/fiduciary-claims/), <b>or</b> <br>
[Multiple party claim](/decision-reviews/multiple-party-claims/)
</div>

## How long does it take VA to make a decision?

<div class="card information">
  <span class="number"><span class="heading-level-3"><i class="far fa-clock vads-u-margin-right--1p5"></i>4-5 months</span></span>
  <span class="description">VA’s goal for completing Supplemental Claims is 125 days.</span>
</div>

## What’s considered new and relevant evidence?

**New evidence** is information that VA didn’t have before the last decision.<br>
**Relevant evidence** is information that could prove or disprove something about your case.

You can submit evidence yourself, or you can ask VA to get evidence, like medical records, that’s at a VA medical center or other federal facility. VA can’t accept your Supplemental Claim without new and relevant evidence.

## How do I file a Supplemental Claim with new evidence?
To file a Supplemental Claim, fill out the Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995). <br>

<li class="process-step list-one">

### Select a benefit type in Part I on the form
