<div itemprop="description" class="va-introtext">
When you choose to file a Supplemental Claim, you’re adding new evidence that’s relevant to your case or identifying new evidence for review. A reviewer will determine whether the new evidence changes the decision.
</div>

<span class="heading-level-3" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"><i class="far fa-copy"></i></span> You must add evidence VA didn’t have before that’s relevant to your case.

<div class="feature" markdown="0">

### Can I file a Supplemental Claim?

You can file a Supplemental Claim anytime if you have new and relevant evidence, but we recommend you file within one year from the date on your decision letter. This protects the most advantageous effective date for you, if your claim is successful and you may be eligible for retroactive benefit payments. <br>

**Note:** You can’t file a Supplemental Claim if you have a [fiduciary claim](/decision-reviews/fiduciary-claims/) or a [multiple party or contested claim](/decision-reviews/multiple-party-claims/).
</div>

## How long does it take VA to make a decision?

<div class="card information">
  <span class="number"><span class="heading-level-3"><i class="far fa-clock vads-u-margin-right--1p5"></i>4-5 months</span></span>
  <span class="description">VA’s goal for completing Supplemental Claims is an average of 125 days.</span>
</div>

## What’s considered new and relevant evidence?

**New evidence** is information that VA didn’t have before the last decision.<br>
**Relevant evidence** is information that could prove or disprove something in your claim.

You can submit evidence yourself or ask VA to get evidence, like medical records from a VA medical center, other federal facility, or your private health care provider. VA can’t accept your Supplemental Claim without new and relevant evidence.

## How do I file a Supplemental Claim with new evidence?
To file a Supplemental Claim, fill out the Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995). <br>
<a href="/decision-reviews/forms/supplemental-claim-20-0995.pdf">Download VA Form 20-0995 (PDF)</a>

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

### Select a benefit type in Part I on the form
The most common benefit type is compensation, but if you’re unsure, check your VA decision. You can’t select multiple benefit types. You must complete a separate form for each type.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

### List the issue(s) you want VA to review in Part II on the form

You can include all or just some of the issues VA decided. You must list the issue(s) you disagree with and the VA decision date.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

### Gather new and relevant evidence to submit

<span class="heading-level-3 vads-u-margin-right--1p5"><i class="far fa-copy"></i></span> You must add new and relevant evidence (supporting documents) or identify evidence you’d like VA to gather for review.

We can help you gather evidence from a VA medical center, other federal facility, or your private health care provider.<br>

**For evidence at a VA or other federal facility**<br>
List the location(s) of VA evidence in Part III. For more details, see the instructions for completing the form.

**For evidence at a private or non-VA source, like a private doctor or employer**<br>
If you want us to gather your evidence from a private provider, fill out and sign [VA Form 21-4142 (PDF)](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-4142-ARE.pdf). Be sure to include it with your Supplemental Claim form (VA Form 20-0995). 

**What if I don’t have any new and relevant evidence?**  <br>
If you don’t have evidence to submit, please select another review option.
