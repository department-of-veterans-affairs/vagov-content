## Decision review options

### Add new and relevant evidence

[Download VA Form 20-0995: Supplemental Claim (PDF)](/decision-reviews/forms/supplemental-claim-20-0995.pdf)

When you choose to file a Supplemental Claim, you’re adding new evidence that supports your case or identifying evidence for review. A reviewer will determine whether the new evidence changes the decision.

### Ask for a new look from a senior reviewer

<br>

When you choose to request a Higher-Level Review, you’re asking for another review of the same evidence. A senior reviewer will take another look at your case and determine whether the decision can be changed based on a difference of opinion or an error.

#### Can I request a Board Appeal?

You can request a Board Appeal after an initial claim, Supplemental Claim, or Higher-Level Review decision. You can’t request two Board Appeals in a row.

## Bring an action in district court

You also have the option to bring an action in a United States district court. You have 6 years to bring such an action after accrual of the right for which the claim is made. You may want to speak with an attorney about this option. <br>

## After a Board decision

If you disagree with the Board’s decision and have new and relevant evidence that supports your case, you can file a Supplemental Claim. You can also appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.
