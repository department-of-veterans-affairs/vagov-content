## Decision Review Options

### Add new and relevant evidence	

The Supplemental Claim option isn’t available for fiduciary claims. You can file a new claim if you have new evidence. 	
<br>

Please choose one of the options below for your next review.

### Ask for a new look from a senior reviewer

[Download VA Form 20-0996 (Higher-Level Review)](/decision-reviews/forms/higher-level-review-20-0996.pdf).

When you choose a Higher-Level Review, you’re asking for another review of the same evidence. A senior reviewer will take another look at your case and determine whether the decision can be changed based on a difference of opinion or an error.

You can request a Board Appeal after an initial claim or Higher-Level Review decision. You can’t request two Board Appeals in a row.

## After a Board Decision

If you disagree with the Board’s decision and have new and relevant evidence that supports your case, you can file a Supplemental Claim. You can also appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.
