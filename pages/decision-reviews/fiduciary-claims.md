## Decision review options

### Add new and relevant evidence

The Supplemental Claim option isn’t available for fiduciary claims. You can file a new claim if you have new evidence.
<br>

Please choose one of the options below for your next review.

### Ask for a new look from a senior reviewer

[Download VA Form 20-0996: Higher-Level Review (PDF)](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0996-ARE.pdf)

When you choose a Higher-Level Review, you’re asking for another review of the same evidence. A senior reviewer will take another look at your case and determine whether the decision can be changed based on a difference of opinion or an error.

#### Can I request a Board Appeal?

You can request a Board Appeal after an initial claim or Higher-Level Review decision. You can’t request two Board Appeals in a row.

## After a Board decision

If you disagree with the Board’s decision and have new and relevant evidence that supports your case, you can file a Supplemental Claim. You can also appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.
