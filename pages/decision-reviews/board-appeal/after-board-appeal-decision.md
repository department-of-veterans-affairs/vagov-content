If you disagree with the Board’s decision, you have 2 options. You can file a Supplemental Claim by adding new and relevant evidence to continue your case, or you can appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.

## Decision review options

### Add new and relevant evidence

If you have new and relevant evidence, you can file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) to continue your review.
