When your review is complete, VA will mail you a decision packet that includes details about the decision on your case.

## What should I do while I wait?

You don’t need to do anything unless VA sends you a letter asking for more information. If VA schedules any exams for you, be sure not to miss them.

If you requested a decision review and haven’t heard back from VA yet, please don’t request another review. Call VA at <a href="tel:+18008271000">800-827-1000</a>.

## What if I want to choose a different review option after I’ve submitted a form?

If you’ve submitted a form and want to change your review option, you can send in a new decision review request form within 1 year from the date on your VA decision. You must include a letter that says you want to withdraw your existing review and switch to a different option. 

If you requested a Board Appeal and want to switch to a different appeal option, you can send in a new Board Appeal form with a different option selected. You can switch appeal options within 1 year from the date on your VA decision or 60 days from the date you submitted your original form.

You can’t select a new review option if you’ve already submitted evidence or had a hearing.
