When your review is complete, VA will mail you a decision packet that includes details about the decision on your case.

## What should I do while I wait?

You don’t need to do anything unless VA sends you a letter asking for more information. If VA schedules any exams for you, be sure not to miss them.

If you requested a decision review and haven’t heard back from VA yet, please don’t request another review. Call VA at <a href="tel:+18008271000">800-827-1000</a>.

## What if I want to choose a different review option after I’ve submitted a form?

**To switch from a Higher-Level Review or a Supplemental Claim:** If your original request hasn’t been decided yet—and you’re still within one year from the date on your VA decision letter—you can switch to a different review option (also called a decision review “lane”). You must include a letter with your new form that says you want to withdraw your existing decision review request and switch to a different lane.

**To switch from a Board Appeal:** You can’t select a different lane if you already submitted evidence or had a hearing for your Board Appeal. If you haven’t submitted evidence or had your hearing yet, you can submit a new [Board Appeal form (PDF)](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/forms/board-appeal-10182.pdf) with a different lane selected. You can switch from a Board Appeal within 1 year from the date on your VA decision letter or 60 days from the date you submitted your original Board Appeal form, whichever is later.
