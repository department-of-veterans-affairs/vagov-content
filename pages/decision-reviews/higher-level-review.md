### Can I request a Higher-Level Review?

You can request a Higher-Level Review of an initial claim or Supplemental Claim decision. You have one year from the date on your decision letter to request a Higher-Level Review. <br>

This option isn’t available after a Higher-Level Review or Board Appeal on the same claim. It’s also not available if you have a [multiple party or contested claim](/decision-reviews/multiple-party-claims/) (this is rare).
</div>

## How long does it take VA to make a decision?
<div class="card information">
  <span class="number"><span class="heading-level-3"><i class="far fa-clock vads-u-margin-right--1p5"></i>4-5 months</span></span>
  <span class="description">
    VA’s goal for completing Higher-Level Reviews is an average of 125 days.</span>
</div>

## What should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer?

If you request an informal conference with a senior reviewer, they’ll call the phone number that you or your representative provide to schedule a time to discuss your case with you. During the call, you and/or your representative can talk about why you think the decision should be changed and identify errors.

**Note:** The senior reviewer will try to reach you or your representative by phone, and if no one answers, they’ll leave a voicemail. If the senior reviewer is unable to leave a message or make contact after 2 attempts, they'll proceed with their review and issue a decision.

## How do I request a Higher-Level Review?

Depending on the type of benefit claim, you can use our online request tool, submit a paper form by mail or fax, or drop it off in person at a regional benefit office near you. 

**Online**
