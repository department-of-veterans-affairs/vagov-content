If you need help requesting a decision review, you may want to work with an accredited attorney, a claims agent, or a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) representative. We trust these professionals because they’re trained and certified in the VA claims and appeals processes and can help you with VA-related needs.

VSOs work on behalf of Veterans and service members—as well as their dependents and survivors. Find out more about accredited representatives and how they can help you.

### What does it take to be an accredited representative or a VSO?

Accredited representatives and VSOs need to:
- Pass an exam
- Pass a background check
- Take continuing-education courses to make sure they’re providing the most up-to-date information

Recognized organizations and individuals can legally represent a Veteran, service member, dependent, or survivor before VA. Non-recognized organizations and individuals can provide information, but can’t be representatives.

## What does an accredited representative or VSO do?
**Accredited representatives and VSOs can help you understand and apply for VA benefits, like:**
- Disability compensation
- Education
- Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E)
- Home loans
- Life insurance
- Pension
- Health care
- Burial benefits

**These trained professionals can also:**
- Help you gather supporting documents (like a doctor’s report or medical test results)
- File a claim or request a decision review on your behalf
- Provide added support, like helping with transportation to medical appointments or emergency funds

**Note:** Veterans Service Officers work for Veterans Service Organizations (both are
called VSOs), as well as for local government offices.

## What does it cost to use an accredited representative or a VSO?

In general, no individual or organization may charge you a fee to help you request a decision review. However, they may charge you for unusual expenses. VA-accredited claims agents and attorneys may charge for their services only after VA makes a decision about your initial claim. Make sure you ask up front about any fees that you’ll be charged. If you believe a claims agent or attorney charged a fee that’s too high, you can challenge it.
