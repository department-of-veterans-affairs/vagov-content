## Decision Review Options

- [Add new and relevant evidence (file a Supplemental Claim)](#supplemental-claim)
- [Ask for a new look from a senior reviewer (request a Higher-Level Review)](#higher-level-review)
- [Appeal to a Veterans Law Judge (request a Board Appeal)](#board-appeal)

<div id="supplemental-claim">

### Add new and relevant evidence

<a href="/decision-reviews/forms/supplemental-claim-20-0995.pdf">Download VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim)</a>.


When you choose to file a Supplemental Claim, you're adding new evidence that supports
your case or identifying evidence for review. A reviewer will look at all the evidence and
determine whether it changes the decision. <br>
[Learn how to file a Supplemental Claim](/decision-reviews/supplemental-claim/).

#### Can I file a Supplemental Claim?

You can file a Supplemental Claim within <b>1 year</b> of a decision if you have new evidence.

But you can’t file a Supplemental Claim if you have a fiduciary claim or you’re one of multiple people claiming the same benefit (this is rare). <br>

### Ask for a new look from a senior reviewer

<a href="/decision-reviews/forms/higher-level-review-20-0996.pdf">Download VA Form 20-0996 (Higher-Level Review)</a>.

When you choose to request a Higher-Level Review, you're asking for another review of the same evidence. A senior
reviewer will take another look at your case and determine
whether the decision can be changed based on a difference of opinion or an error that VA made. <br>
