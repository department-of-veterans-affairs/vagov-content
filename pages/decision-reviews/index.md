### Add new and relevant evidence

<a href="https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0995-ARE.pdf">Download VA Form 20-0995: Supplemental Claim (PDF)</a>


When you choose to file a Supplemental Claim, you're adding new evidence that supports
your case or identifying evidence for review. A reviewer will look at all the evidence and
determine whether it changes the decision. <br>

</div>

#### Can I file a Supplemental Claim?

You can file a Supplemental Claim anytime if you have new evidence. **Note:** You can’t file a Supplemental Claim if you have a fiduciary claim or a multiple party or contested claim (this is rare). <a href="#rare-situations">See if one of these rare situations applies to you</a>

#### Is there a deadline for filing a Supplemental Claim?

You can file anytime if you have new evidence, but we recommend you file within one year from the date on your decision letter. This protects the most advantageous effective date for you, if your claim is successful and you may be eligible for retroactive benefit payments.

### Ask for a new look from a senior reviewer

<a href="https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0996-ARE.pdf">Download VA Form 20-0996: Higher-Level Review (PDF)</a>

When you choose to request a Higher-Level Review, you're asking for another review of the same evidence. A senior
reviewer will take another look at your case and determine
whether the decision can be changed based on a difference of opinion or an error that VA made. <br>

## After a Board decision

If you disagree with the Board’s decision and have new and relevant evidence that supports your case, you can file a Supplemental Claim. You can also appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <br>
