## Information to help you decide if you'd like to participate

When it comes to research, our highest priority is protecting you. Part of this means giving you all the information you need to decide if volunteering to be a participant in a research study is right for you.

### About health research and how it works

<ul class="usa-accordion">
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="what-is-health-research">What is health research, and why is it important?</button>
<div id="what-is-health-research" class="usa-accordion-content">

Research is an organized process to gather information so we can better understand a specific problem. Health (or medical) research helps us answer big questions about human health, like "How does COVID-19 affect different groups of people?" and "How can we find an effective vaccine?" 

**Health research can help us:**
- Learn more about health issues, risks, and illnesses
- Test a vaccine, medication, or medical device to make sure it's safe and effective
- Find the best way to prevent or treat an illness 
- Learn what health care practices work best

The treatments and medicines that people rely today come from health research. In fact, research studies we've conducted here at VA have contributed to health advances like the first successful liver transplant and new treatments for Alzheimer's, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS.

<div id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-research-study-participant" class="usa-accordion-content">

A research study participant is a person who volunteers to take part in a research study. 

For health research studies, this means that researchers will observe the participant to learn more about the specific question the study is trying to answer. Health research studies try to answer many different questions. A study may try to answer a question about how different eating or exercising habits affect people's health over time, how different approaches to health care work compared to each other.

Some studies try to answer the question of whether a new vaccine or treatment works and is safe for people of different ages, genders, races, and ethnicities. Research participants in these types of studies may receive the vaccine or treatment, and researchers will monitor them closely to find out if it works as intended and if it has any side effects. Other participants may receive a placebo (a sterile liquid that doesn't contain the real vaccine or treatment) so researchers can compare the groups of participants. 

In all health research studies, participants are volunteers who have the right to know all the details of the study and to leave the study at any time.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="why-participate">Why should I consider participating in COVID-19 research?</button>
<div id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-research-study-participant" class="usa-accordion-content">

Because COVID-19 is so new, we have a lot to learn. We can't learn without doing research. And we can't do research without people who participate in research studies.

**As a research study participant, you can help us:**
- Better understand how COVID-19 affects different people
- Find ways to prevent and treat COVID-19 for you, your family, and your community
- Make sure vaccines and treatments are safe and effective in people of all ages, genders, races, and ethnicities

**You may also:**
- Learn more about your own health
- Receive more regular health check-ins as part of your study visits
- Get early access to a new vaccine or treatment

No one can predict the exact outcome of a research study. You may or may not see a direct benefit to your health. But your participation does matter.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="diverse">Why is it important for people of different ages, races, ethnicities, and gender identities to participate in this research?</button>
<div id="diverse" class="usa-accordion-content">

When research involves a group of people who are similar in age, gender, race, and ethnicity, the results for that group may not be true for everyone.

**Different people may:**
- Have different health needs or challenges
- Need different dosages of a vaccine or treatment to get the intended result
- Experience different side effects from a vaccine or treatment

We're working to find the best ways to prevent and treat COVID-19 in everyone. So to do that, we must include people of all ages (over 18 years old), gender identities, races, and ethnicities in our research studies.

We especially want to make sure that any vaccines or treatments work in the people who data shows are most affected by COVID-19. This includes people over age 65, people with chronic (long-term) health conditions, and Black, Latino, and indigenous populations.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="risks">What are the risks of participating in a health research study?</button>
<div id="risks" class="usa-accordion-content">

As part of our informed consent process, the study staff will discuss the possible risks of the specific study you're considering before you agree to join. 

**Some common risks of participating in a research study include:**

- **Possible side effects.** If you join a study that's testing a new vaccine or treatment, you may experience side effects. Most side effects of vaccines are minor (like a sore arm, low fever, or muscle aches) and go away after 1 or 2 days. The study staff will monitor your health. If you do experience more severe side effects, they'll work with you to make sure you get the care you need.
- **Not receiving the vaccine or treatment being tested.** For example, in a trial to determine if a vaccine or treatment works, we need to compare 2 groups: a group that receives the vaccine or treatment we're testing and a group that receives a placebo (a sterile liquid that doesn't have any active ingredients). To make sure the results aren't affected by knowing which group is which, neither you nor the researchers will know which group you're in until after the study ends.
- **Inconvenience or disruption to your work or home schedule.** You may need to spend time traveling to the VA health facility where research will take place.

### What to expect if you participate in a COVID-19 study at VA

<ul class="usa-accordion">

<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="what-to-expect">What should I expect if I'm eligible for a study?</button>
<div id="what-to-expect" class="usa-accordion-content">

The first thing you should know is that signing up doesn't mean you're committing to join a research study. It just means you want to learn more. Here's what to expect if you decide to sign up, and if we think you may be eligible for a specific study.

#### Before the study

If we contact you about a study, we'll give you written information about the study. We'll also discuss all of the details of the study, including possible risks, with you to help you decide whether you want to join. This process is called informed consent.

If you decide you want to join the study, our researchers will determine if you're eligible to participate.
  
**As part of this, you may:**
 - Answer questions about your medical history
 - Get a physical exam
 - Get a blood test

#### During the study

If you're eligible, you can then join the study. Remember, it's always your choice and you can decide to leave a study at any time.
  
**During the study, we may ask you to:**
- **Go to a VA health facility near you.** For most studies, you'll need to go for 10 or more visits over 1 to 2 years.
- **Get injections or infusions.** You may get the study product we're researching, or you may get a placebo. A placebo is a liquid with no active ingredients.
- **Keep track of how you feel.** We'll likely ask you to write down how you feel for about a week after you get each injection or infusion. The study staff will also contact you to ask how you're feeling.
  
**Note:** We won't expose you to the virus that causes COVID-19 as part of any studies. If you do get sick during the study, we'll work with you to make sure you get the care you need.

#### After the study

We the study is complete, we may ask you if we can contact you again for another study. You can say no if you'd prefer.
  
We'll also share the results of the study with you and your community. We won't include your or any other participants' name or any information that can be used to identify you.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="protect-safety"How will VA protect my safety during a study?</button>
<div id="protect" class="usa-accordion-content">

Today, strong laws are in place in the U.S. to protect the safety of every person who joins a study. 

**Safety measures for VA research include:**

- **Ethical guidelines and training.** We work to make sure that all members of our research teams act professionally at all times and follow the highest standards of quality and ethics in their work.
- **Institutional review boards (IRBs).** Like all clinical research studies in the U.S., each VA study must go to an IRB before it can start. This is a group of people such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, scientists, ethicists, and people from the local community who make sure that human research is well-planned and ethical. The IRB also reviews each study while it is going on to make sure volunteers are protected.
- **VA research and development (R&D) committee.** At VA,  we also have an R&D committee reviews the work and recommendations of the IRB and must also approve the research before our researchers can ask you to take part.
- **Informed consent.** Before you join a study, the staff will explain all you need to know to decide if you want to join. They'll share information, including how the study will work, any possible risks, and how often you'll need to visit the study location. They'll also answer any questions you may have about the study. You must then sign an "informed consent" document confirming that you received and understood this information before agreeing to join.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="protect-privacy">How will VA protect my privacy?</button>
<div id="protect-privacy" class="usa-accordion-content">

Like your medical record, we'll keep the information in your research record confidential (or private). 

**To protect your privacy, including your person and health information, we:**

- Make sure that our researchers only have access to the specific information they need to complete each study. The institutional review board (IRB) determines what information is needed for each study. The IRB is a group of people such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, scientists, ethicists, and people from the local community who make sure that human research is well-planned and ethical. 
- Store all information in our secure electronic systems, and encrypt all sensitive data.
- Require all VA employees who handle sensitive data to take required training and ongoing education courses on privacy and data security

<div id="affect-health-care" class="usa-accordion-content">

No. 

##### If you're currently enrolled in VA health care

Joining a study won't affect your benefits or the care you receive in any way.

Your research study visits will be separate from your regular health care appointments. If you get sick during the study, your VA health care team will care for you in the same way they would if you weren't part of research.

##### If you're a service member or Veteran and you're not currently enrolled in VA health care

Joining a study won't affect your eligibility for VA health care in any way.
