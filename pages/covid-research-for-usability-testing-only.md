As one of the nation's leaders in health research, we're working to help find ways to better prevent and treat COVID-19. Find out how you can participate and what to expect if you volunteer.

## Why should I consider being a participant in a VA COVID-19 research study?

Because COVID-19 is so new, we have a lot to learn. We can't learn without doing research. And we can't do research without people who volunteer to participate in research studies.

**As a research study participant, you can help us:**
- Better understand how COVID-19 affects different people
- Find ways to prevent and treat COVID-19 for you, your family, and your community
- Make sure vaccines and treatments are safe and effective in people of all ages, genders, races, and ethnicities

**You may also:**
- Get early access to a new vaccine or treatment 
- Learn more about your own health
- Receive more regular health check-ins as part of your study visits

### Sign up for our volunteer list

If we think you may be eligible for a study, we'll contact you to tell you more about it so you can decide if you want to join.

**Note:** You must be at least 18 years old to participate. You don't have to be a Veteran or enrolled in VA health care.

## What is health research, and why is it important?

Research is an organized process to gather information so we can better understand a specific problem. Health (or medical) research helps us answer big questions about human health, like "How does COVID-19 affect different groups of people?" and "How can we find an effective vaccine?" 

**Health research can help us:**
- Learn more about human health
- Test a vaccine, medication, or medical device to make sure it's safe and effective
- Find the best way to prevent or treat an illness 
- Learn what health care practices work best

The medicines many of us rely today come from health research.


## What can I expect if I sign up for VA's COVID-19 volunteer list?

<p>The first thing you should know is that signing up doesn't mean you're committing to join a research study. It just means you want to learn more.  Here's what to expect if you decide to sign up, and if we think you may be eligible for a specific study.</p>

<ol class="process" markdown="1">

  <li class="process-step list-one">
  
  Sign up for our volunteer list <br>
  Complete our brief online form to sign up for our volunteer list. If we think you may be eligible for a study, we'll contact you.
  
  **Note:** We won't share your personal or health information with anyone outside of VA.
  
  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-two">
  
  Get more information about a study <br>
  If we contact you about a study, we'll give you written information about the study. We'll also discuss all of the details of the study with you by phone or in person to help you decide whether you want to join the study or not. This process is called informed consent.
  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-three">
  
  Find out if you're eligible for the study <br>
  If you decide you want to join the study, our researchers will determine if you're eligible to participate.
  
  **As part of this, you may:**
  - Answer questions about your medical history
  - Get a physical exam
  - Get a blood test

  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-four">
  Participate in the study<br>  
  If you're eligible, you can then join the study. Remember, it's always your choice and you can decide to leave a study at any time.
  
  **During the study, you may:**
  - **Go to the research site.** For most studies, you'll need to go for 10 or more visits over 1 to 2 years.
  - **Get injections or infusions.** You may get the study product we're researching, or you may get a placebo. A placebo is a liquid with no active ingredients.
  - **Keep track of how you feel.** We'll likely ask you to write down how you feel for about a week after you get each injection or infusion. The study staff will also contact you to ask how you're feeling.
  
**Note:** We won't expose you to the virus that causes COVID-19 as part of any studies. If you do get sick during the study, we'll work with you to make sure you get the care you need.

  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-five">
  Complete your participation <br>
  When the study is complete, we may ask you if we can contact you again for another study. You can say no if you'd prefer.
  
  We'll also share the results of the study with you and your community. We won't include your or any other participants' name or any information that can be used to identify you.
  
    </li>
</ol>

## What are the risks of joining a research study? 


When it comes to research, our highest priority is protecting you. Part of this means giving you all the information you need to decide if volunteering for a research study is right for you. The research study staff will explain in detail all of the possible risks of a specific study before you agree to join. 

**Some common risks include:**

- **Possible side effects.** If you join a study that's testing a new vaccine or treatment, you may experience side effects. Most side effects of vaccines are minor (like a sore arm, low fever, or muscle aches) and go away after 1 or 2 days. The study staff will monitor your health. If you do experience more severe side effects, they'll work with you to make sure you get the care you need.
- **Not receiving the vaccine or treatment being tested.** For example, in a trial to determine if a vaccine or treatment works, we need to compare 2 groups: a group that receives the vaccine or treatment we're testing and a group that receives a placebo (a sterile liquid that doesn't have any active ingredients). 
- **Inconvenience or disruption to your work or home schedule.** You may need to spend time traveling to the VA health facility where research will take place.
