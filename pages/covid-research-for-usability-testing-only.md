## Why might I want to be part of COVID-19 research at VA?

COVID-19 is caused by a new virus. So we have a lot to learn about how it affects different people and how to best prevent and treat it. We can't learn without doing research. And we can't do research without volunteers to help.

**By being part of this research, you can help us:**
- Better understand the unique needs of Veterans when it comes to COVID-19
- Find ways to prevent or treat COVID-19 for you, your family, and your community
- Make sure vaccines and treatments work well in people of different ages, genders, races, and ethnicities

**You may also:**
- Get access to a new vaccine or treatment before it's available to most people
- Learn more about your health so you can better understand your risks and how to improve your health
- Receive more regular health check-ins with providers as part of your study visits

### Sign up for our COVID-19 research volunteer list

If you're at least 18 years old, you can sign up for our COVID-19 research volunteer list. You don't need to be a Veteran or enrolled in VA health care. If we think you may be eligible for a study, we'll contact you to tell you more about it so you can decide if you want to join.

## What is health research, and why is it important?

Research is an organized process to gather information so we can better understand a specific problem. Health (or medical) research helps us answer big questions about human health, like "How does COVID-19 affect different groups of people?" and "How can we find an effective vaccine?" 

**Health research can help us:**
- Learn more about human health
- Test a vaccine, medication, or medical device to make sure it's safe and effective
- Find the best way to prevent or treat an illness 
- Learn what health care practices work best

The medicines many of us rely today come from health research.

## Why should I consider volunteering for resarch with VA instead of with other organizations or companies?





## What can I expect if I sign up for VA's COVID-19 volunteer list?

<p>The first thing you should know is that signing up doesn't mean you're committing to join a research study. It just means you want to learn more.  Here's what to expect if you decide to sign up, and if we think you may be eligible for a specific study.</p>

<ol class="process" markdown="1">

  <li class="process-step list-one">
  
  Sign up for our volunteer list <br>
  Complete our brief online form to sign up for our volunteer list. If we think you may be eligible for a study, we'll contact you.
  
  **Note:** We won't share your personal or health information with anyone outside of VA.
  
  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-two">
  
  Get more information about a study <br>
  If we contact you about a study, we'll give you written information about the study. We'll also discuss all of the details of the study with you by phone or in person to help you decide whether you want to join the study or not. This process is called informed consent.
  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-three">
  
  Find out if you're eligible for the study <br>
  If you decide you want to join the study, our researchers will determine if you're eligible to participate.
  
  **As part of this, you may:**
  - Answer questions about your medical history
  - Get a physical exam
  - Get a blood test

  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-four">
  Participate in the study<br>  
  If you're eligible, you can then join the study. Remember, it's always your choice and you can decide to leave a study at any time.
  
  **During the study, you may:**
  - **Go to the research site.** For most studies, you'll need to go for 10 or more visits over 1 to 2 years.
  - **Get injections or infusions.** You may get the study product we're researching, or you may get a placebo. A placebo is a liquid with no active ingredients.
  - **Keep track of how you feel.** We'll likely ask you to write down how you feel for about a week after you get each injection or infusion. The study staff will also contact you to ask how you're feeling.
  
**Note:** We won't expose you to the virus that causes COVID-19 as part of any studies. If you do get sick during the study, we'll work with you to make sure you get the care you need.

  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-five">
  Complete your participation <br>
  When the study is complete, we may ask you if we can contact you again for another study. You can say no if you'd prefer.
  
  We'll also share the results of the study with you and your community. We won't include your or any other participants' name or any information that can be used to identify you.
  
    </li>
</ol>

## What are the risks of joining a research study? 


When it comes to research, our highest priority is protecting you. Part of this means giving you all the information you need to decide if volunteering for a research study is right for you. The research study staff will explain in detail all of the possible risks of a specific study before you agree to join. 

**Some common risks include:**

- **Possible side effects.** If you join a study that's testing a new vaccine or treatment, you may experience side effects. Most side effects of vaccines are minor (like a sore arm, low fever, or muscle aches) and go away after 1 or 2 days. The study staff will monitor your health. If you do experience more severe side effects, they'll work with you to make sure you get the care you need.
- **Not receiving the vaccine or treatment being tested.** For example, in a trial to determine if a vaccine or treatment works, we need to compare 2 groups: a group that receives the vaccine or treatment we're testing and a group that receives a placebo (a sterile liquid that doesn't have any active ingredients). 
- **Inconvenience or disruption to your work or home schedule.** You may need to spend time traveling to the VA health facility where research will take place.
