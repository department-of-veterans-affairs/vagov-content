## Veterans state cemeteries

Most states have state-run Veterans cemeteries, which are different from VA national cemeteries. Eligibility for burial in a Veterans state cemetery is determined by each state. Some states might require legal proof that the Veteran lived in the state (also called "residency") in order to be eligible for burial in a Veterans state cemetery. 

If you need more information, please contact a Veterans state cemetery office directly. [Use our facility locator tool](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?zoomLevel=4&page=1&address=&facilityType=cemetery&serviceType) to find contact information for Veterans state cemeteries.
