### What documents do I need to apply for a Civil War or Spanish-American War headstone? 

To apply for a headstone or marker in a historical style, you'll need to show proof of the Veteran's military service with detailed primary documentation. This can include Compiled Military Service Records (CMSR), details from official state files, federal pension documents, or land warrants.

The fee for requesting records is between $25 and $75. The National Archives will send your records 60 to 90 days from the date of your request.
