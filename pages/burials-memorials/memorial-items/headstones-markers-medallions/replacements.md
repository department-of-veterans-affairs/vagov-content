## Who pays for a replacement headstone or marker?

We'll replace a government-issued headstone or marker, at no cost to you, for any of these reasons:

- Its condition has gotten worse over time.
- The inscription can no longer be easily read.
- The inscription isn't correct.
- It was stolen or vandalized.
- It was damaged during shipping.
- It doesn't meet the contract requirements.

**Note:** We won't cover the cost if the headstone or marker is located in a private cemetery and has been damaged by cemetery personnel. In this case, the private cemetery is responsible for paying all replacement costs. 

## Will the replacement headstone or marker look the same as the original?

Yes. When we replace a historic (more than 50 years old) headstone or marker, the replacement is the same type and style as the original (called "replacing in kind").
  
## What happens to a headstone or marker that's been removed? 

If a marble or granite headstone or marker is removed from a grave, it must be destroyed so the inscription can no longer be read. Bronze markers must be returned to the contractor.
