### Can I get allowances to help pay for a Veteran's burial and funeral costs?

You may be able to get burial allowances if you're paying for the burial and funeral costs and you won't be reimbursed by any other organization, like another government agency or the Veteran's employer. The requirements listed below must also be true.

**One of these relationships or professional roles describes your connection to the Veteran. You’re:**

- The Veteran’s surviving spouse (**Note:** we recognize same-sex marriages), **or**
- The surviving partner from a legal union (a relationship made formal in a document issued by the state recognizing the union), **or**
- A surviving child of the Veteran, **or**
- A parent of the Veteran, **or**
- The executor or administrator of the Veteran’s estate (someone who officially represents the Veteran)

**The Veteran must not have received a dishonorable discharge, and one of these circumstances must be true. The Veteran died:**

- As a result of a service-connected disability (a disability related to service), **or**
- While getting VA care, either at a VA facility or at a facility contracted by VA, **or**
- While traveling at VA's expense to approved VA care, **or**
- With an original or reopened claim pending for VA compensation or a pension that would have qualified them to get benefits, **or**
- On or after October 9, 1996, while a patient at a VA-approved state nursing home

**Or the Veteran:**
- Had been getting a VA pension or compensation when they died, **or**
- Had chosen to get military retired pay instead of compensation

**Note:** We'll also provide an allowance for the cost of transporting a Veteran’s remains for burial in a national cemetery.

#### You can't get burial allowances for certain individuals

We don't provide burial allowances if the individual died:

- On active duty, **or**
- While serving as a member of Congress, **or**
- While serving a federal prison sentence

</div>

## Is there a time limit for filing?

You must file a claim for a non-service-connected burial allowance within 2 years after the Veteran’s burial or cremation. If a Veteran’s discharge was changed after death from dishonorable to another status, you must file for an allowance claim within 2 years after the discharge update.

There's no time limit to file for a service-connected burial, plot, or interment allowance.

## What kind of benefits can I get?

For burial in a national cemetery, you'll receive an allowance for:

- Burial and funeral costs
- The plot (gravesite) or interment
- Transporting the Veteran’s remains for burial

**Note**: The Veteran's family will need to cover the cost of funeral director services, like cremation.

## What documents do I need to send with my application?

**You'll need to send copies of these documents:**
- The Veteran’s military discharge papers (DD214 or other separation documents)
- The Veteran’s death certificate
- Any documents or receipts you have for the cost of transporting the Veteran’s remains
- A statement of account (preferably with the letterhead of the funeral director or cemetery owner) that has this information:
  - The Veteran's name, **and**
  - The type of service or item purchased, **and**
  - Any credits, **and**
  - The unpaid balance

## As a surviving spouse, do I need to file a claim for burial costs?
No, you don't need to file a claim as a surviving spouse. When we receive notice of the Veteran’s death, we automatically pay a set amount to eligible surviving spouses of record to help cover burial and funeral costs. But you'll need to file a claim for additional benefits to help pay for the plot, the cost of interment, or transportation of the remains to the cemetery.
