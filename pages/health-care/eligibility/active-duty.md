<h2>Enhanced eligibility for returning OEF/OIF/OND combat Veterans</h2>

You can receive free VA health care for up to 5 years after discharge or release for any condition related to your service in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) or Operation New Dawn (OND) in Iraq. This is called an enhanced eligibility period.

<h3>We encourage you to apply right away</h3> 
If you wait to apply for VA health care until after your enhanced eligibility period ends, we won't factor your OEF/OIF/OND combat Veteran status into our decision on your enrollment. Instead, we'll base your eligibility on factors such as your income and VA disability rating. So even if you don't think you need medical care right now, we encourage you to apply for VA health care right away to take advantage of this enhanced eligibility period. <br>

<h2>Eligibility after separation (including active National Guard and Reserve members)</h2>

You may be eligible for VA health care for all or some of your health care needs. We'll determine your eligibility based on your service history, VA disability rating, income, and other factors. If you had active-duty status for training purposes only, you don’t qualify for VA health care.<br>

You and your family may also qualify for temporary health coverage through the Department of Defense's TRICARE program. If you're a member of the National Guard and Reserve, your coverage options will depend on your military status before you separate. You'll have 90 days from your separation date to change your health plan.

<h2>Eligibility after retirement</h2>

You may be eligible to receive care through VA for any service-connected disabilities. You may also qualify to receive all other care through TRICARE. Your eligible family members may also qualify for care through TRICARE. 

To learn more about your options, talk with a VA benefits counselor. Your counselor will help you determine what your military and VA medical board ratings mean and how they affect your options. Your counselor will also help you apply for benefits.

Call our health benefits hotline at <a href="tel:+18778387">877-8387</a> to connect with a benefits counselor.  If you have hearing loss, call TTY: 800-877-8339. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. Or contact your nearest VA medical center. <br>

<h2>Getting started with VA health care</h2>

<h3>Can I apply for VA health care before I've ended my service?</h3>

Yes. You can apply as soon as you’ve received your separation or retirement papers. If we determine you’re eligible, you’ll be enrolled once you’ve separated or retired.

<h3>Can I use VA health care while I'm still on active duty?</h3>

<b>You may be able to use VA health care if:</b>

- You need emergency or urgent care. We'll provide care first, and then get TRICARE authorization for care once we've stabilized your health. <br>
- You need routine care and you have a valid TRICARE referral or authorization.
- The VA health facility you're visiting has a VA/DoD sharing agreement that allows us to provide care without referrals. For more information about this, please contact your local military hospital or clinic (also called a military treatment facility) or TRICARE office. <br>

<h3>What if I've just separated and I don't know where to start?</h3>

We can help you learn about and apply for VA health care benefits. A member of our Concierge for Care (C4C) team will call you soon after your separation from military service. We can answer any questions you may have, process your application over the phone, and help you schedule your first VA medical appointment.
