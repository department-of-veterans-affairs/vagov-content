<span id="oef-oif-ond"></span>

### If you're returning from OEF/OIF/OND combat

You can receive cost-free medical care for up to 5 years after discharge or release for any condition related to your service in Operating Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) or Operation New Dawn (OND) in Iraq. This is your called an enhanced eligibility period.

- Were discharged or released from active service on or after January 29, 2003, <b>and</b>
- Didn't receive a dishonorable discharge

[Learn more about priority groups](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#priority-groups)
- <b>You'll receive free care and medications for any condition that may be related to your combat service.</b> You may need to pay copays for care and medications that we determine are clearly not related to your military service, but you can submit your income as part of your application to apply for a copay exemption. <br>
[Learn more about how we determine your health care costs](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/cost/index.asp) <br>

[Learn more about priority groups](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#priority-groups)

#### Importance of applying right away
If you wait to apply for VA health care after your OEF/OIF/OND enhanced eligibility period ends, we won't factor your OEF/OIF/OND combat Veteran status into our decision on your enrollment. Instead, we'll base your eligibility on factors such as your income and VA disability rating.

So even if you don't think you need medical care right now, we encourage you to apply for VA health care right away to take advantage of this enhanced eligibility period. <br>

## More questions you may have about getting started with VA health care

### Can I apply for VA health care before I've ended my service?

Yes. You can apply as soon as you’ve received your separation or retirement papers. If we determine you’re eligible, you’ll be enrolled once you’ve separated or retired.

### Can I use VA health care while I'm still on active duty?

<b>You may be able to use VA health care if:</b>

- You need emergency or urgent care. We'll provide care first, and then get TRICARE authorization for care once we've stabilized your health. <br>
- You need routine care and you have a valid TRICARE referral or authorization.
- The VA health facility you're visiting has a VA/DOD sharing agreement that allows us to provide care without referrals. For more information about this, please contact your local military treating facility (MTF) or TRICARE office.

### What if I've just separated and I don't know where to start?

We can help you learn about and apply for VA health care benefits. A member of our Concierge for Care (C4C) team will call you soon after your separation from military service. We can answer any questions you may have, process your application over the phone, and help you schedule your first VA medical appointment.
