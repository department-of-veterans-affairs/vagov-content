## Getting Started

If you need support for a specific mental health problem—or if you're having problems sleeping, controlling your anger, or readjusting to civilian life—you are not alone. And we can help.

Over 1.7 million Veterans received mental health services at VA last year. Our services range from peer support with other Veterans to counseling, therapy, medication, or a combination of these options. Our goal is to help you take charge of your treatment and live a full and meaningful life.

### How do I schedule my first appointment?

**If you're already using VA medical services,** ask your primary care provider to help you make an appointment with a VA mental health provider.

**If you're not already using VA medical services,** contact your nearest VA medical center or Vet Center to talk about your needs. <br>
[Find your nearest VA medical center or Vet Center](/find-locations/?zoomLevel=4&page=1&facilityType=health).

### What if I'm not sure what kind of help I need?

You can call 1-877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+18002228387">1-877-222-8387</a>) to find the right resources for your needs. If you have hearing loss, call TTY: <a href="tel:+18008778339">1-800-877-8339</a>.

We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (ET)

### It's hard for me to get to a VA facility in person. Can I get mental health services online?

Yes. You may be able to use one or more of the care options listed below.

- **The Veteran Training online self-help portal for overcoming everyday challenges:** You can use this portal's tools to help manage your anger, develop parenting and problem-solving skills, and more. The tools are based on proven mental health practices that have successfully helped other Veterans and families. The portal is free, and you don't have to sign in or provide any personal information to use the tools.<br>
[Visit the Veteran Training portal](http://www.veterantraining.va.gov).

- **Smartphone apps for Veterans:** We've partnered with the Department of Defense (DoD) to create free smartphone applications you can use to help manage your physical and mental health. These include apps to help you deal with stress, quit smoking, and more.<br>
[Learn more about apps for Veterans](https://ncgwg.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Resources_-Apps-for-Veterans.pdf).

- **The VA TeleMental Health program:** You can connect with a VA mental health provider through a computer or mobile device in your home or at your nearest VA health facility. If you're enrolled in VA health care, ask any of your providers to help connect you with our telemental health program.

### Can I speak to a fellow Veteran who's been through this before?

Yes. The **BeThere** peer assistance program, in partnership with Military OneSource, offers support to service members (including National Guard Soldiers and Reservists), their families, and transitioning Veterans up to 365 days after separation or retirement. Through this program, you can talk privately with peer coaches who are Veterans, service members, or military spouses.

To talk with a peer coach, call Military OneSource's free, confidential peer support services at <a href="tel:+1800-342-9647">1-800-342-9647</a>. This service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

### What other options do I have?

**If you're a combat Veteran,** you can visit one of our Vet Centers to get free individual and group counseling for you and your family. You can access these services even if you're not enrolled in VA health care and aren't receiving disability compensation.

**Vet Centers offer services such as:**
- Military sexual trauma (MST) counseling
- Readjustment counseling
- Bereavement (grief) counseling
- Employment counseling
- Substance abuse assessment and referral

**If you'd like to connect with other Veterans, families, and local services,** you can visit our Make the Connection website. This site connects millions of Veterans, and their family members and friends, to local VA and community mental health resources.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-risk">Will using mental health services at VA put my career at risk?</button>
<div id="questions-risk" class="usa-accordion-content">

Being diagnosed with a mental health condition or seeking mental health care doesn't automatically put work-related credentials, such as security clearances, at risk. Most employers recognize that healthy employees who get help when they need it are more productive and effective in their jobs than those who aren't performing at their best because they're not feeling well.
