<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a disability that was caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service and that limits your ability to work or prevents you from working, you may be eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) benefits and services. Find out if you can get employment support or help living as independently as possible.

### If I'm a Veteran, can I get VR&amp;E benefits and services?

You may be eligible for VR&E benefits and services if you’re a Veteran, and you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true. You:**

- Didn't receive a dishonorable discharge, **and**
- Have a service-connected disability rating of at least 10% from VA, **and**
- [Apply for VR&E services](/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/how-to-apply/)

<br>

#### Basic period of eligibility

**Your basic period of eligibility ends 12 years from the date you received notice of your:**
- Date of separation from active military service, **or**
- First VA service-connected disability rating

**Please note:** The basic period of eligibility may be extended if a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) finds that you have a Serious Employment Handicap (SEH). Having an employment handicap means your service-connected disability limits your ability to prepare for, obtain, and maintain suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse, is stable, and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests).

<br>

### If I'm still on active duty, can I get VR&amp;E benefits and services?

You may be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits and services if you're a Servicemember and you meet at least one of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true. You:**

- Have a 20% or higher pre-discharge disability rating (memorandum rating) and will soon leave the military, **or**
- Are participating in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) process or awaiting discharge due to a medical condition resulting from a serious injury or illness that occurred in the line of duty. <br>
[Learn more about accessing VR&E services through IDES](/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/ides/).

**Please note:** Severely injured active-duty Servicemembers can automatically receive VR&E benefits before VA issues a disability rating, because of Sec. 1631(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act (PL 110-181). The sunset date of that law has been extended to September 30, 2018, through Sec. 724 of Public Law 113-291.

<br>

### What should I do if I received an other than honorable, bad conduct, or dishonorable discharge?

If you've received one of these discharge statuses, you may not be eligible for VA benefits.

**There are 2 ways you can try to qualify:**

**Note:** You can apply even if you're a Servicemember without a disability rating yet.


### What kind of VR&E services can I get?

**Depending on your needs and goals, services may include:**

- A complete evaluation to determine your abilities, skills, and interests for employment
- Vocational counseling and rehabilitation planning for employment services
- Employment services such as job training, resume development, and other work-readiness support
- Help finding and keeping a job, including the use of special employer incentives and job accommodations
- On the Job Training (OJT), apprenticeships, and non-paid work experiences
- Post-secondary training at a college, vocational, technical, or business school
- Supportive rehabilitation services including case management, counseling, and medical referrals
- Independent living services if you're unable to work due to the severity of your disabilities

### What happens after I apply for VR&E services? 
After you apply, we'll schedule a meeting for you with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) to find out if you have an employment handicap and if you’re eligible for VR&E benefits and services. You have an employment handicap if your service-connected disability limits your ability to prepare for, obtain, and maintain suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse, is stable, and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests).

After we make an entitlement decision, you and your counselor will work together to develop a rehabilitation plan. 

### What's included in a rehabilitation plan? 
A rehabilitation plan is a written plan that outlines the resources we'll use to help you find employment. Depending on your situation, your VRC will work with you to choose one of the following support-and-services tracks to help you find and keep a job, and live as independently as possible: 
- Reemployment with a former employer
- Job placement and counseling services for new employment
- Help with starting your own business 
- Long-term training or services to help you find work in a different field that better suits your abilities and interests
- Independent living services if you can’t return to work right away
