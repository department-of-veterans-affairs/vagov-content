<div class="va-introtext">

If you're a military spouse or surviving spouse, find out if you're eligible and how to apply for the Department of Defense's Spouse Education Career Opportunities (SECO) program. And learn about other resources to help you build your career or start a small business.

</div>

Through the Department of Defense’s [Spouse Education Career Opportunities](https://myseco.militaryonesource.mil/Portal/) (SECO) program, spouses can use government-sponsored career and education resources, take advantage of networking opportunities, and work with employment counselors. SECO also partners with the [Military Spouse Employment Partnership](https://msepjobs.militaryonesource.mil/msep/) (MSEP) and [My Career Advancement Account (PDF)](https://myseco.militaryonesource.mil/Portal/Media/Default/Collaterals_Catalog/Program_Overview/MyCAA-Helping-Spouses-Reach-Career-Goals.pdf) (MyCAA) scholarship program. These organizations and others (such as [Blue Star Families](https://www.bluestarfam.org/)) offer assistance for spouses interested in the following:

- Connecting with employers committed to hiring military spouses.
- Pursuing additional education and/or training.

### Am I eligible for SECO services?

- You are the spouse of an active-duty, National Guard, or Reserve service member in the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, or Air Force.
- You are the spouse of a service member who has been separated from active duty, National Guard, or Reserves for less than 180 days.

- If you are a surviving spouse, the [Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors](https://www.taps.org/) offers seminars, peer mentors, and other forms of support to help you complete your education or find a sustainable career.
- Spouses can attend Department of Labor Employment Workshops (DOLEW) online through the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) Virtual Curriculum on [Joint Knowledge Online](https://jkodirect.jten.mil), on the [Department of Labor website](https://www.dol.gov/vets/), or in person at some military installations. These workshops focus on building resumes and cover letters as well as developing networking and interviewing skills.
