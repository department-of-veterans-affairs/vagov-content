### Can I get education benefits under the MGIB-SR program?

You can get education benefits under this program if you meet the requirements listed below. 

**One of these must be true. You:**
- Have a 6-year service obligation (you agreed to serve 6 years) in the Selected Reserve, **or**
- Are an officer in the Selected Reserve and you agreed to serve 6 years in addition to your initial service obligation

**Note:** Your obligation must have started after June 30, 1985, or for some types of training after September 30, 1990.

**And all of these must also be true. You:**
- Complete your initial active duty for training (IADT), **and**
- Get a high school diploma or certificate of equal value, like a High School Equivalency Diploma or GED, before finishing IADT (**Note:** You can't use 12 hours toward a college degree to meet this requirement), **and**
- Stay in good standing while serving in an active Selected Reserve unit <br>
(**Note:** You'll still be eligible if you're discharged from Selected Reserve service due to a disability that was not caused by misconduct)

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="eligibility-0">How long can I receive benefits if I stay in the Selected Reserve?</button>
<div id="eligibility-0" class="usa-accordion-content">
 
You can receive benefits until your eligibility period ends or you use all of your entitlement, whichever comes first. "Entitlement" means the number of months of benefits you may receive.

If you stay in the Selected Reserve, you'll be eligible for 14 years after you started your first 6-year obligation. 

We may extend your eligibility period if you're called to active duty. If this happens, we'll extend your eligibility for the amount of time you're mobilized plus 4 months. For example, if you're mobilized for 12 months, we'll extend your eligibility period for 16 months. This extension still applies even if you leave the Selected Reserves after mobilization.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="eligibility-1">Can I receive MGIB-SR benefits after I leave the Selected Reserve?</button>
<div id="eligibility-1" class="usa-accordion-content">
 
This depends on the reason you left. Your eligibility for this program usually ends the day you leave the Selected Reserve. But there are exceptions to this rule.

You can still qualify for MGIB-SR benefits for 14 years from the date of your first 6-year obligation if any of the below descriptions are true for you.

**At least one of these must be true:**
- You separated because of a disability that wasn't caused by misconduct, **or**
- Your unit was deactivated between October 1, 2007, and September 30, 2014, **or**
- You involuntarily separated (not by choice) for reasons other than misconduct between October 1, 2007, and September 30, 2014
