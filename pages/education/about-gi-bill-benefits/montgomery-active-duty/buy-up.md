## How do I get this benefit?

- Decide how much extra you want to contribute. With a $600 contribution, you can get up to $5,400 more in GI Bill benefits. <br>[View the rate table](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rates/600_buyup.asp)
- Fill out a form called Montgomery GI Bill Act of 1984 Basic Enrollment (DD Form 2366) and take it to your payroll or personnel office. <br> [Get DD Form 2366 (PDF)](http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/forms/dd/dd2366.pdf)
- Keep copies of the form and any other paperwork that shows you made the payment.

**Note:** This program can’t be used with the Post 9/11 GI Bill.
