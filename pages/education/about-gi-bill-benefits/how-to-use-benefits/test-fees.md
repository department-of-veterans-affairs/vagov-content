The GI Bill covers more than just tuition. You can use part of your entitlement to cover the cost of certain tests you need to take to become a licensed or certified professional—or to apply for college or a training course. We only cover tests approved for the GI Bill under this benefit, so find out what’s approved before you take any tests.

**Note:** If you don't see a test listed, it still may be a valid test that's not yet approved. Please submit an application for reimbursement.

### What you should know about test benefits

**We:**

- Will pay for tests for as many approved licenses or certifications as you'd like.
- Will pay for tests even if you don't score high enough to get your license or certification. You can take the same test as many times as you need.
- Will pay for you to retake a test you passed if you need to take it again to get recertified or retain a license you already have.
- Won't pay for fees or costs related to getting the actual license or certification document.
- Won't pay more than $2,000 in fees for one test.


**For tests taken after August 1, 2018,** we'll prorate the entitlement charges under the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on the actual amount of the fee charged for the test.
