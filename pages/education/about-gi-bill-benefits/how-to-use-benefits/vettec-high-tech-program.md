If you want to gain computer skills and experience to start or advance your career in the high-technology industry, find out if you're eligible for our new Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) program.

## What's VET TEC?

VET TEC is a new program that matches you with a leading training provider who can help you develop high-tech skills. You can start or advance your career in the high-tech industry with a training program that'll take months—or just weeks—to complete.

VET TEC is a five-year pilot program. You can participate as long as the funding is available.

### Am I eligible for this program?

You may be eligible for VET TEC if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true. You:**
-	Aren't on active duty, **and**
-	Qualify for VA education assistance under the GI Bill, **and**
- Have at least one day of unexpired GI Bill entitlement, **and**

You can get training in one of these high-demand training areas:
-	Computer software

## What benefits can I get through this program?

With VET TEC, you can get:
-	Tuition for a full-time high-tech training program
-	Money for housing during your training

**If you attend your training program in person,** your housing stipend will be equal to the monthly military Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for an E-5 with dependents. This is based on the zip code where you attend your training. 

**If you participate in an online program,** your stipend will be half of the BAH national average for an E-5 with dependents. 

**Note:** If you don't attend a training for a full month, we'll prorate your housing payment for the days you train.

## How do I apply?

First, you'll need to apply for the VET TEC program by filling out an Application for Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Course (VA Form 22-0994).

If we determine that you're eligible for VET TEC, you'll then apply to the VA-approved training provider of your choice. Your training provider may review your qualifications to assess whether they think you'll be able to successfully complete their training program and find meaningful, relevant employment.
