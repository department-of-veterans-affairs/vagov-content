## What's VET TEC?

VET TEC is a new program that matches you with a leading training provider who can help you develop high-tech skills. You can start or advance your career in the high-tech industry with a training program that'll take months—or just weeks—to complete.

VET TEC is a five-year pilot program. You can participate as long as the funding is available.

## What benefits can I get through this program?

With VET TEC, you can get:
-	Tuition for a full-time high-tech training program

**If you attend your training program in person,** your housing stipend will be equal to the monthly military Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for an E-5 with dependents. This is based on the zip code where you attend your training. 

**If you participate in an online program,** your stipend will be half of the BAH national average for an E-5 with dependents. 

**Note:** If you don't attend a training for a full month, we'll prorate your housing payment for the days you train.

## How do I apply?

First, you'll need to apply for the VET TEC program by filling out an Application for Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Course (VA Form 22-0994).
