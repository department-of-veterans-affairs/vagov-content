### If you're in the Reserves

You can get this benefit if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true:**

-	You’re a current Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) recipient or a Reservist using the Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR) program, **and**
- You're enrolled in a qualifying high-tech, non-degree program that lasts for 2 years or less, **and**
