Since 1944, the GI Bill has helped millions of Veterans pay for college, graduate school, and training programs. Under this bill, qualifying Veterans and their family members can get money to cover all or some of the costs for school or training. Learn more about these benefits below—and how to apply for them.

If you applied for and were awarded Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits, your GI Bill Statement of Benefits will show you how much of your benefits you’ve used and how much you have left to use. [View your GI Bill Statement of Benefits](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/ch-33-benefit).

The GI Bill Comparison Tool and Veterans service organizations can help you explore options and find out what benefits you can get. [Find a Veterans service organization](https://www.va.gov/vso/).
