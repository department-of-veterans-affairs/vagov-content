You have 10 years from your release from active duty to use your VEAP benefits. If you don't use the money after 10 years, we'll automatically refund it to you.

**Note:** If you’re on active duty now and want to use VEAP, you must have at least 3 months of contributions in the fund.

### Can I get the money back that I put into my VEAP account?

Yes. You can withdraw the money in your VEAP account if you don’t meet basic qualifying requirements or if you formally ask for a refund.

To ask for a refund, complete an Application for Refund of Educational Contributions (VA Form 22-5281).<br>
