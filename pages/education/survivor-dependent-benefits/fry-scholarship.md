### Can I get Fry Scholarship benefits?

You may be able to get benefits under the Fry Scholarship if you’re the child or surviving spouse of an active-duty service member who died in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001.

#### As the child of a service member

- You can be married or unmarried.
- **If you turned 18 or graduated from high school before January 1, 2013,** you can get a Fry Scholarship until you're 33 years old.
- **If you turn 18 or graduate from high school after January 1, 2013,** you can get a Fry Scholarship at any age over 18 or after you graduate (whichever comes first).
- **If your parent died in the line of duty before August 1, 2011,** you may qualify for both the Fry Scholarship and the Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA) program. But you can use only one program at a time. We cap combined benefits at 81 months of full-time training.<br>
[Read about the DEA program](/education/survivor-dependent-benefits/dependents-education-assistance/).
- **If you're receiving Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC),** you'll need to give up those payments when you start to use the Fry Scholarship. <br>
[Read about DIC](https://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/types-dependency_and_indemnity.asp).


#### As the spouse of a service member

- **If you remarry,** you'll no longer be eligible for the Fry Scholarship.
- You can still get Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) payments while using the Fry Scholarship.<br>
[Read about DIC](https://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/types-dependency_and_indemnity.asp).
</div>

### What benefits can I get?
You may be able to get up to 36 months of benefits, including:
- Money for tuition (full in-state tuition costs at public schools and up to $22,805.34 per year for training at private or out-of-state schools)
- Money for housing
- Money for books and supplies
