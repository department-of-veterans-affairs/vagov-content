**Note:** The Post-9/11 GI Bill has replaced the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) for Reserve and National Guard members called to active duty on or after September 11, 2001. But if you applied for REAP on or after November 25, 2015, you may still qualify for VA education benefits. <br>[Learn more about REAP](/education/other-va-education-benefits/reap/)
