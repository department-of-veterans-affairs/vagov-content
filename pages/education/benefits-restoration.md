<div class="va-introtext">

If you were receiving GI Bill education benefits, but your school either closed or lost its approval to receive payments from us (also called disapproved), you may be able to get your benefits again. Find out how we may be able to restore your benefits based on the The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (also called the Forever GI Bill).

### My school was disapproved. What does that mean?

It usually means that the school has charged Veterans more than the rate for resident students. Federal law (Section 3679(c) 
of Title 38, United States Code) says that schools must charge in-state, or resident, tuition and fee amounts to “covered 
individuals.” These students include those Veterans getting Post-9/11 GI Bill or Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty benefits, 
and those whose school terms began after July 1, 2017.

To remain approved for VA’s GI Bill programs, schools must charge in-state tuition and fee amounts to Veterans 
receiving these benefits.

### Do I qualify to get these benefits reinstated?

If you attended a college or university (also called an institution of higher learning) from January 1, 2015, to August 16, 2017, using your GI Bill benefits, and you haven’t transferred any of your credits to another college, you may qualify. We may be able to restore the entitlement you used for the term you were attending that stopped before its scheduled end date.
This may have happened because the program or school closed or was disapproved. Or the school may have been removed from 
the program.

## How can I get these benefits back?

Section 109 of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (also called the Forever GI Bill) allows VA 
to restore entitlement to Veterans affected by a school closure or disapproval. If the school was disapproved, 
that disapproval must be a result of a change in a law or in our interpretation of a law.

This law defines two types of restoration of entitlement cases, a **special application case** or a **regular restoration of 
entitlement case**. See below to see which type of case may apply to you.

### What’s a special application case?

If you qualify for this special application case, you won’t be charged entitlement for the **entire time you were enrolled** 
at the closed school. We’ll retroactively restore any entitlement you may have been charged from the start of your enrollment 
period at the school.

You’ll qualify for the special application provision if you meet the requirements listed below.

**Both of these must be true:**

- You went to an accredited institution of higher learning that closed between January 1, 2015, and August 16, 2017, **and**
-	Last went to the school within 120 days of the school’s closure.

**And at least one of the following must be true. You:**

-	Weren’t enrolled in a comparable program before August 16, 2017, **or**
-	Were enrolled in a comparable program, but didn’t transfer any credits from the closed school.

### What’s a regular restoration of entitlement case?

If you qualify for regular restoration of entitlement, you won’t be charged for the **individual term, quarter, or semester**
you were enrolled in at the time of the school closure or disapproval.

You’ll qualify for the regular restoration of entitlement provision if you meet the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true:**

-	We decide that you were unable to complete the program of study because the school closed, **or**
-	There’s a change in law or VA interpretation resulting in the disapproval of the program or school, and because of that, 
you didn’t receive credit or you lost training time toward the completion of the education program.

### My school closed or was disapproved while I was enrolled. Can I still get my monthly housing allowance?

If your school closes or is disapproved while you’re attending, you may be eligible to keep receiving monthly housing
allowance (MHA) payments. These payments would last until the original end of the school term, or for 120 days, whichever
happens sooner. This payment can be made only if the closure or disapproval happened on or after August 16, 2017.

You won’t lose any of your entitlement for the monthly housing allowance payments made during this period.

### What if my school closed after August 16, 2017?

You may qualify for the regular restoration of entitlement provision if you meet the requirements listed below. 
We won’t charge you for the term, quarter, or semester you were attending if you meet one of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true:**

-	Your college or program closed permanently, **or**
-	A change in VA regulations or a new law caused your program to end, and you didn’t receive credit, or you lost training 
time for your program.

### I’m using the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Will I still get my monthly housing allowance?

If your course ended after August 16, 2017, we’ll pay your housing allowance until the end of the term, quarter, or 
semester that you attended and finished, or were unable to finish because the school closed. We’ll pay you through 
the end of the term, or for 120 days after the school or program ends, whichever is sooner.

### How do I apply for restoration of entitlement?

If your school closed and you believe you meet the requirements outlined above, you’ll need to apply.

Fill out the Education Benefit Entitlement Restoration Request Due to School Closure or Withdrawal form (VA Form 22-0989).
[Download VA Form 22-0989](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-0989-ARE.pdf).

You’ll use this form for either special application or for regular restoration of entitlement. When we approve your 
claim, we’ll tell you which type of restoration you’ll receive.

**You can then submit this form in one of several ways. You can:**

-	Submit it online through the “Submit a Question” button on the [GI Bill website](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/).
