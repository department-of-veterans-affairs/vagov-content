Yes. It’s important to update your information with us if you change your marital status, have a baby, adopt a child, or experience any other life change that could affect your rating or payment.

<b>If you have a disability rating of 30% or higher</b>, you may be able to add eligible dependents to your VA disability compensation to get a higher payment (also called a "benefit rate"). <br>
<a href="https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/add-dependents.asp">Find out how to add eligible dependents</a>.

<b>If your disability gets worse</b>, you can file a claim for an increase in benefits. <br>
