We refer to the first claim you file for a disability as your original claim.

**You can file a claim up to 180 days before leaving the service:**

- **If you have 180-90 days left on active duty**, you may be able to file a pre-discharge claim through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. This may help speed up the claim decision process so you can get your benefits sooner.<br>
[Find out how to file a pre-discharge claim](/disability/how-to-file-claim/when-to-file/pre-discharge-claim/)

- **If you have less than 90 days left on active duty**, you can't file your claim through the BDD program. But you can still file before you're discharged, and your claim will be processed after separation as a fully developed or standard claim.<br>
[Learn more about gathering evidence for standard and fully developed claims](/disability/how-to-file-claim/evidence-needed/)

**You can also file a claim for a disability that appears after discharge:**

This is called a postservice claim. There's no time limit on filing a postservice claim. But you should know that the process may become more complex the longer you wait.

<div id="claim-increased" class="usa-accordion-content">

You can file a claim for increased disability compensation if you have a rated service-connected disability that’s gotten worse. You’ll need to submit up-to-date medical evidence that shows your disability has gotten worse.

**You can file an increased claim to request:**
- An increase in your disability rating
- More financial support

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="claim-more-benefits">New claim—file a claim for added benefits or other benefit requests related to an existing service-connected disability.</button>
<div id="claim-more-benefits" class="usa-accordion-content">

**You can file a new claim to request:**
- More financial support
- Special monthly payments
- A shift to Individual Unemployability status (a status given to Veterans who are unable to work because of a disability)<br>

Our decision on your new claim will be based only on new evidence (like a doctor's report or medical test results) that you give us to support your claim. We won't consider any evidence you may have given us related to past claims.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="claim-secondary">Secondary service-connected claim—file a claim for a new disability that’s linked to a service-connected disability you already have.</button>
<div id="claim-secondary" class="usa-accordion-content">

You can file a secondary claim to get more disability benefits for a new disability that's linked to a service-connected disability you already have.

**For example, you might file a secondary claim if you:**
- Develop arthritis that's caused by a service-connected knee injury you got while on active duty, **or**
- Develop heart disease that's caused by the high blood pressure you were diagnosed with while on active duty and that we'd previously concluded was connected to your service

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="claim-special">Special claim—file a claim for special needs linked to your service-connected disability.</button>
<div id="claim-special" class="usa-accordion-content">

You can file a special claim to request compensation for special needs.

**These may include needs like:**
- A specially equipped vehicle if your service-connected disability prevents you from driving, **or**
- Temporary payments if you're recovering from surgery or other treatment and unable to move, **or**
- Increased payments if you can't work because of your service-connected disability

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="claim-new-evidence">Supplemental claim—provide new evidence to support a disability claim that was denied.</button>
<div id="claim-new-evidence" class="usa-accordion-content">

You can file a supplemental claim if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true:**
- We denied your disability claim, **and**
- You didn’t file an appeal at that time, **and**
- You have new and material evidence (new supporting documents like a doctor’s report or medical test results) that we haven’t seen before and that's directly related to your claim

For example, you might file a supplemental claim if you were treated for pain in your elbow while on active duty, but you were denied disability benefits because your VA health exam didn't find a problem. Then 2 years later, an X-ray of your elbow showed signs of arthritis (a painful swelling and sometimes wearing down of a joint). In this case, you would need to send your new exam and X-ray results to us as new evidence related to the claim.<br>
