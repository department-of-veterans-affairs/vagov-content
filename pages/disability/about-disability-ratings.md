<h2>How we assign VA disability ratings</h2>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">

<h3 itemprop="name">What is a VA disability rating?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

We assign you a disability rating based on the severity of your disability. We express this rating as a percentage, representing how much your disability decreases your overall health and ability to function.

We then use your disability rating to determine your disability compensation rate, so we can calculate how much money you’ll receive from us each month. We also use your disability rating to help determine your eligibility for other benefits, like VA health care.

<h3 itemprop="name">What does VA use to decide my disability rating?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

<strong>We base your rating on:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The evidence you give us (like a doctor’s report or medical test results), <strong>and</strong></li>
  <li>The results of your VA claim exam (also called a compensation and pension, or C&P, exam), if we determine you need this exam, <strong>and</strong></li>
  <li>Other information we may get from other sources (like federal agencies)</li>

<h3 itemprop="name">What if I have more than one disability?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

We’ll use a method called the “whole person theory” to determine what we call your combined disability rating. We do this to make sure that your total VA disability rating doesn’t add up to more than 100%. That’s because a person can’t be more than 100% able-bodied.

<h3 itemprop="name">How do ratings work for a disability I had before entering the service that got worse because of my service?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

If you get disability benefits for a preservice disability, we’ll base your monthly compensation amount on the level of aggravation. Level of aggravation means how much worse your preservice disability got because of your military service.

<strong>For example:</strong> If you had an illness or injury (also known as a condition) that was rated as 10% disabling when you entered the military, and it became 20% disabling due to the effects of your service, then the level of aggravation would be 10%.

<h2>How we determine combined VA disability ratings</h2> (not rounded)

If you have more than one disability, we’ll use the combined ratings table below to calculate your combined disability rating. 

To make this table easier to use online, we’ve separated it into smaller tables, based on the percentage of the most severe, or highest rated, disability (as shown in the left column of each table). 

<strong>Note:</strong> If you have 2 disabilities, each rated at 10% disabling, your combined disability rating is 19%.

<h3>How we use the combined ratings table</h3>

<strong>We’ll follow these steps to calculate your combined rating:</strong>
  
<h4>Step 1:</h4>
We’ll start by putting your disability ratings in order, from highest to lowest percentage. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>For example:</strong> If you had 2 disabilities rated as 50% disabling and 30% disabling, we’d rank them in this order: 50%, then 30%.

<h4>Step 2:</h4>
Next, we’ll look for your highest rating in the left column of the combined ratings table, and the next highest rating in the top row of the combined ratings table. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>In our example:</strong> We’d look for 50 in the left column and 30 in the top row.
  
|    | 10 | 20 | *30* | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| ***50*** | 55 | 60 | 65 | 70 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 90 | 95 |

<h4>Step 3:</h4>  
Then, we’ll look across from the 50 in the left column and down from the 30 in the top row to find the number that appears where the left column and top row meet. This is the combined value of the 2 ratings. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>In our example:</strong> This would be 65.
  
|    | 10 | 20 | *30* | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| ***50*** | 55 | 60 | ***65*** | 70 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 90 | 95 |
  
<h4>Step 4:</h4>
<strong>If you have 2 disabilities</strong><br>
We’ll round that combined value to the nearest 10% to find your combined disability rating. We’ll round combined values ending in 1 to 4 down, and those ending in 5 to 9 up. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>In our example:</strong> Your combined disability rating would be 70%.
  
<h4>Step 5:</h4>
<strong>If you have more than 2 disabilities</strong>
We’ll repeat the process for each additional disability. This means we’ll take the combined value (before rounding) of the first 2 disability ratings and then combine that with the third highest rating, and so on until we’ve added all disability ratings. We’ll round the final value to the nearest 10% to find your combined disability rating. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>For example:</strong> If we added a third disability rated at 10% disabling to our original example, we would take your combined value of 65 and look for that number in the left column of the combined ratings table. We would then look for 10 in the top row—and find the number where the left column and top row meet. In this example, that number would be 69. <br>
 
|    | *10* | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **60** | 64 | 68 | 72 | 76 | 80 | 84 | 88 | 92 | 96 |
| **61** | 65 | 69 | 73 | 77 | 81 | 84 | 88 | 92 | 96 |
| **62** | 66 | 70 | 73 | 77 | 81 | 85 | 89 | 92 | 96 |
| **63** | 67 | 70 | 74 | 78 | 82 | 85 | 89 | 93 | 96 |
| **64** | 68 | 71 | 75 | 78 | 82 | 86 | 89 | 93 | 96 |
| ***65*** | ***69*** | 72 | 76 | 79 | 83 | 86 | 90 | 93 | 97 |

<br>
We would then round this number up to 70%, and this would be your combined disability rating.
