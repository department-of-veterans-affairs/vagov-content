Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) are forms that help us give you the right disability compensation for your illness. 
After your health care provider fills out the form related to your condition, they submit it to us. Then we begin the review 
to decide your disability compensation.

## What are Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) and why might I need them?

If you are disabled as a result of your military service, you are entitled to disability compensation pay. 
The first step in determining your monthly disability compensation is to have a health care provider fill out 
one or more of our disability questionnaires. Then they or you submit the forms to us.
