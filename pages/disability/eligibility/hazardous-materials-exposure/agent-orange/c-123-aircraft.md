<div class="va-introtext">

If you flew on—or worked with—C-123 aircraft in Vietnam or other locations, you may have had contact with Agent Orange. The U.S. military used this toxic chemical to clear trees and plants during the Vietnam War. C-123 aircraft sprayed Agent Orange during the war, and the planes still had traces of the chemical in them afterward while they were being used, up until 1986. Find out if you can get disability compensation or benefits for illnesses believed to be caused by contact with Agent Orange.

### Can I get disability benefits from VA?

<br>

#### For active-duty service members

You may be able to get disability benefits if you have an illness believed to be caused by contact with Agent Orange and both of the below descriptions are true for you.

**Both of these must be true:**

- You served in a regular Air Force unit location where a C-123 aircraft with traces of Agent Orange was assigned, **and**
- Your flight, ground, or medical duties put you in regular and repeated contact with C-123 aircraft that had traces of Agent Orange

If you have an illness believed to be caused by Agent Orange, you won’t need to show the problem started during—or got worse because of—your military service. This is because we believe that certain diseases are the result of exposure to herbicides. We refer to these as "presumptive diseases."<br>
[See a list of Agent Orange—related illnesses](/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/agent-orange/related-diseases/)

Check our list of military units and Air Force specialty codes to see if your unit had contact with affected C-123 aircraft. <br>

<br>

#### For Reservists

You may be able to get disability benefits if you have an illness believed to be caused by Agent Orange and you were assigned to flight, ground, or medical crew duties at one of the below locations.

**You must have been assigned to one of these locations:**

- **Lockbourne/Rickenbacker Air Force Base** in Ohio, 1969-1986 (906th and 907th Tactical Air Groups or 355th and 356th Tactical Airlift Squadrons), **or**
- **Westover Air Force Base** in Massachusetts, 1972-1982 (731st Tactical Air Squadron and 74th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron, or 901st Organizational Maintenance Squadron), **or**
- **Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania International Airport**, 1972-1982 (758th Airlift Squadron)

If you have an illness believed to be caused by Agent Orange, you won’t need to show the problem started during—or got worse because of—your military service. This is because we believe that certain diseases are the result of exposure to herbicides. We refer to these as "presumptive diseases."<br>
