<div class="va-introtext">

If you flew on—or worked with—C-123 aircraft in Vietnam or other locations, you may have had contact with Agent Orange. The U.S. military used this herbicide to clear trees and plants during the Vietnam War. C-123 aircraft sprayed Agent Orange during the war, and the planes still had traces of the chemical in them afterward while they were being used, up until 1986. Find out if you can get disability compensation and other benefits for illnesses we believe are caused by contact with Agent Orange.

### Can I get disability benefits from VA?

<br>

#### For active-duty service members

You may be able to get disability benefits if the below descriptions are true for you.

**This must be true:**

- You have an illness we believe is caused by contact with Agent Orange (called a presumptive disease)

**And both of these must also be true:**

- You served in a regular Air Force unit location where a C-123 aircraft with traces of Agent Orange was assigned, **and**
- Your flight, ground, or medical duties put you in regular and repeated contact with C-123 aircraft that had traces of Agent Orange

**If you have an illness we believe is caused by Agent Orange,** you won’t need to show the problem started during—or got worse because of—your military service. This is because we believe that certain diseases are the result of exposure to herbicides. We refer to these as "presumptive diseases."<br>
