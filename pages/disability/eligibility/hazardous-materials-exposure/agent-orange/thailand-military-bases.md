<div class="va-introtext">

If you had regular security duty on the fenced-in perimeters of a U.S. military base in Thailand or Royal Thai Air Force Bases between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, you may have had contact with Agent Orange. The U.S. military used this herbicide to clear trees and plants during the Vietnam War. We refer to this as a presumption of contact. Find out if you can get disability compensation and other benefits for illnesses we believe are caused by contact with Agent Orange.
