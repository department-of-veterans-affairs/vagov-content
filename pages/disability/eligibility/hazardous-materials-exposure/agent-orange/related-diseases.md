If you have an illness you think is caused by contact with Agent Orange—and you don’t see it listed here—you can still file a claim for disability compensation. You’ll need to show that you have a disability and include a doctor’s report or a hospital report stating that your illness is believed to be caused by contact with Agent Orange.
