We believe that contact with Agent Orange, an herbicide used to clear trees and plants during the Vietnam War, likely causes several illnesses. We refer to these as presumptive diseases. Find out if you can get disability compensation or benefits if you had contact with Agent Orange while serving in the military and now have one or more of the illnesses listed below.

- **[Diabetes mellitus type 2](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/conditions/diabetes.asp):** An illness that happens when your body is unable to properly use insulin (a hormone that turns blood glucose, or sugar, into energy), leading to high blood sugar levels

### If you have an illness you believe is caused by contact with Agent Orange—and you don’t see it listed above

You can still file a claim for disability compensation. 

**You’ll need to:**
- Provide scientific and medical evidence that the condition is related to exposure to Agent Orange, **or** 
- Show that the problem started during—or got worse because of—your military service

Scientific proof may include an article from a medical journal or a published research study.
