### Can I get disability benefits from VA?

You may be able to get disability benefits if you have symptoms related to a traumatic event (the “stressor”) or your experience with the stressor is related to the PTSD symptoms, and you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true:**
- The stressor happened during your service, **and**
- You can’t function as well as you once could because of your symptoms, **and**
- A doctor has diagnosed you with PTSD

### What does VA consider to be a traumatic event?

We consider any of these to be a traumatic event:

- You suffered a serious injury, personal or sexual trauma, or sexual violation, **or**
- You were threatened with injury, sexual assault, or death

<br>

### Who’s covered?

Veterans
</div>

## What kind of disability benefits can I get?

- Health care
- Compensation (payments)
- Treatment for PTSD

--------

## How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to file a claim for disability compensation. <br>

[Find out how to file a claim for disability compensation](/disability/how-to-file-claim/)

When you file a disability claim, you'll also need to fill out one of these additional forms:
- A Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (VA Form 21-0781).<br>
[Download VA Form 21-0781](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0781-ARE.PDF)<br>
 **or**<br>
- A Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Secondary to Personal Assault (VA Form 21-0781a).<br>
[Download VA Form 21-0781a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0781a-ARE.PDF)

**Note:** In our screening process, we'll focus on getting a full understanding of your PTSD to help determine your eligibility for disability benefits. We won't offer you treatment during this process.

**If you’re looking for treatment options,** please talk with your health care provider or learn more about accessing VA services for PTSD. <br>
