### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to file a claim for disability compensation. <br>

[Find out how to file a claim for disability compensation](/disability/how-to-file-claim/)

When you file a disability claim, you'll also need to fill out one of these additional forms:
- A Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (VA Form 21-0781).<br>
[Download VA Form 21-0781](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0781-ARE.PDF)<br>
 **or**<br>
- A Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Secondary to Personal Assault (VA Form 21-0781a).<br>
[Download VA Form 21-0781a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0781a-ARE.PDF)

**Note:** In our screening process, we'll focus on getting a full understanding of your PTSD to help determine your eligibility for disability benefits. We won't offer you treatment during this process.

**If you’re looking for treatment options,** please talk with your health care provider or learn more about accessing VA services for PTSD. <br>
