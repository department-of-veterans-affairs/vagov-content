## Keep in touch
It’s important to update your information with VA when you have a new address, a change to your marital status, or any other life change that could affect your rating or payment. If your disability gets worse, you can file a claim for an increase in benefits.

Update your information in 1 of 2 ways:
- [Make the change directly in eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=dependent-compensation), **or**
- [Contact your nearest VA regional benefit office](/find-locations/?facilityType=benefits)
