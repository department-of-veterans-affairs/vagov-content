<h5>How to use these tables to find your monthly payment</h5>

Start with the <strong>Basic special monthly compensation rates</strong> table. Find the dependent status in the left column that best describes you. Then look for your SMC letter designation in the top row. Where your dependent status and SMC letter meet, you'll find your monthly payment.

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with a dependent spouse but no dependent parents or children, and you had an SMC-M designation, you'd receive <strong>$4,368.59</strong> each month.

<strong>If you have a spouse who receives Aid and Attendance</strong>

First find your basic SMC rate. Then look at the <strong>Added amounts</strong> table. Add the amount that matches your disability rating to your basic SMC rate to find your total monthly payment. 

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with a spouse who was receiving Aid and Attendance, and you had an SMC-M designation, you would start with the basic rate of $4,368.59 for a Veteran with spouse (no parents or children). Then you would add the $156.32 rate for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance. 

Your total monthly payment would be $4,368.59 + $156.32 = <strong>$4,524.91</strong>. <br>

<h5>How to use these tables to find your monthly payment</h5>

Start with the <strong>Basic special monthly compensation rates</strong> table. Find the dependent status in the left column that best describes you. Then look for your SMC letter designation in the top row. Where your dependent status and SMC letter meet, you'll find your monthly payment.

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with one child and a spouse but no dependent parents, and you had an SMC-L designation, you'd receive <strong>$4,099.32</strong> each month.

<strong>If you have more than one child</strong>

We provide different rates for children who are under the age of 18 and those who are over 18 and in a qualifying school program. To find your total monthly payment, find your basic SMC rate. Then look at the <strong>Added amounts</strong> table. Add the amount for each child, depending on their age and school status and your SMC designation.

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with 3 dependent children under 18, one dependent child over 18 in a qualifying school program, and a dependent spouse, and you had an SMC-L designation, you would start with your basic SMC rate of $4,099.32 for a Veteran with one child and spouse (no parents). Then you would add the rate of $84.69 for each additional child under age 18 (so $84.69 x 3) and the rate of $273.58 for each additional child over 18 in a qualifying school program. 

Your total monthly payment would be $4,099.32 + ($84.69 x 3) + $273.58 = <strong>$4,626.97</strong>.

<strong>If you have a spouse who receives Aid and Attendance</strong>

First find your basic SMC rate. Then look at the <strong>Added amounts</strong>. Find the rate for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance based on your SMC designation, and add it to your basic SMC rate. If you have more than one child, add the amount for each additional child as well. 

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with 2 dependent children under 18 and a dependent spouse receiving Aid and Attendance, and you had an SMC-L designation, you would start with your basic SMC rate of $4,099.32 for a Veteran with one child and spouse (no parents). You would then add the rate of $84.69 for each additional child under age 18 (so $84.69 x 2) as well as the rate of $156.32 for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance. 

Your total monthly compensation rate would be $4,099.32 + ($84.69 x 2) + $156.32 = <strong>$4,425.02</strong>. <br>
