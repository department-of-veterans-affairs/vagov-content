<h5>How to use these tables to find your monthly payment</h5>

Start with the <strong>Basic rates</strong> table. Find the dependent status in the left column that best describes you. Then look for your disability rating in the top row. Where your dependent status and disability rating meet, you'll find your monthly payment.

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with a dependent spouse but no dependent parents or children, and you had a 30% disability rating, you'd receive <strong>$479.83</strong> each month.

<strong>If you have a spouse who receives Aid and Attendance</strong>

First find your basic rate. Then look at the <strong>Added amounts</strong> table. Find the amount that matches your disability rating and add it to your basic rate to get your total monthly payment. 

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with a dependent spouse who was receiving Aid and Attendance but no dependent parents or children, and you had a 30% disability rating, you would start with the basic rate of $479.83 for a Veteran with spouse (no parents or children). Then you would add the $47.00 rate for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance.

Your total monthly payment would be $479.83 + $47.00 = <strong>$526.83</strong>. <br>

<h5>How to use these tables to find your monthly payment</h5>

Start with the <strong>Basic rates</strong> table. Find the dependent status in the left column that best describes you. Then look for your disability rating in the top row. Where your dependent status and disability rating meet, you'll find your monthly payment.

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with a dependent child and spouse but no dependent parents, and you had a 30% disability rating, you'd receive <strong>$1,522.71</strong> each month.

<strong>If you have more than 1 child</strong>

We provide different rates for children who are under the age of 18 and those who are over 18 and in a qualifying school program. 

To find your total monthly payment, first find your basic rate. Then look at the <strong>Added amounts</strong> table. Find the added amount for each child, depending on their age and school status and your disability rating.

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with 3 dependent children under 18, 1 dependent child over 18 in a qualifying school program, and a dependent spouse, and you had a disability rating of 30%, you would start with your basic rate of $516.83 for a Veteran with 1 child and spouse (no parents). You would then add the rate of $25.00 for each additional child under age 18 (so $25.00 x 3) and the rate of $191.00 for each additional child over 18 in a qualifying school program. 

Your total monthly payment would be $516.83 + ($25.00 x 3) + $82.00 = <strong>$623.83</strong>.

<strong>If you have a spouse who receives Aid and Attendance</strong>

First find your basic rate. Then look at the <strong>Added amounts</strong> table. Find the amount for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance that matches your disability rating and add it to your basic rate to get your total monthly payment. If you also have more than 1 child, you'll add the amount for each additional child as well. 

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with 2 dependent children under age 18 and a dependent spouse receiving Aid and Attendance, and you had a 30% disability rating, you would start with your basic rate of $516.83 for a Veteran with 1 child and spouse (no parents). You would then add the rate of $25.00 for each additional child under age 18 (so $25.00 x 2) and the rate of $47.00 for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance. 

Your total monthly payment would be $516.83 + ($25.00 x 2) + $47.00 = <strong>$613.83</strong>. <br>

We provide different rates for dependent children who are under the age of 18 and those who are over 18 and in a qualifying school program.

Then look at the <strong>Added amounts</strong> table. Find the added amount for each dependent child, depending on their age and school status and your disability rating.

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with 3 dependent children under 18, 1 dependent child over 18 in a qualifying school program, and a dependent spouse, and you had a 70% disability rating, you would start with your basic rate of $1,609.71 for a Veteran with 1 child and spouse (no parents). You would then add the rate of $59.00 for each additional child under age 18 (so $59 x 3) and the rate of $191.00 for each additional child over 18 in a qualifying school program. 

Your total monthly payment would be $1,609.71 + ($59.00 x 3) + $191.00 = <strong>$1,997.71</strong>.
