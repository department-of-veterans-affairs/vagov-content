      <h2 id="what-harassment-is-and-when-to">What harassment is and when to report it</h2>
      <p>Harassment is any unwelcome behavior that creates a hostile space. It can make you feel uncomfortable, unsafe, intimidated, or offended. It can sometimes be sexual in nature. And it can come in many forms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Verbal comments or threats</li>
        <li>Physical gestures or threats</li>
        <li>Images, emails, text messages, or written messages</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Harassment is not your fault. And it can happen to anyone.</p>
      <p>We encourage you to tell us right away—or whenever you’re ready—if either of these situations happens to you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Someone makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe at VA.</strong> This can include at a VA location, during a phone or video call, or in written communications. We’ll support you through each step of the reporting and resolution process. And we’ll connect you with any counseling or other support you may need.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You see or hear harassment of someone else at VA.</strong> We’re committed to making VA a comfortable and safe place for all. And we need your help.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If someone touches your body in a sexual way without your consent, call <a aria-label="9 1 1." href="tel:911">911</a> or the VA police to get help right away.</p>
