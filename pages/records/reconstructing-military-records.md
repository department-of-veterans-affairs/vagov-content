### Were my records destroyed in the 1973 NPRC fire in St. Louis?

## Reconstructing your records

### How does VA reconstruct my records?

We submit a specific request to the NPRC for any additional service records they may have or can find for you.

With the information we provide, the NPRC searches for documents that may help to reconstruct your records. They may also reach out to other government agencies. For example, they may try to reconstruct portions of your service treatment records by reviewing unit records, morning reports, and hospital admission records from the surgeon general's office.

### How can I get the records I need to support my VA disability compensation claim?

If you're filing a [VA disability compensation claim](/disability/how-to-file-claim/), follow the steps below to get the records you need.

#### Gather or request other records or documents

We'll also look at other records or documents (called “supplemental records”) to help decide your claim. You can provide these records or ask us to help you find them. 

**Please send us any of these documents you may have:**
- Statements from service medical personnel
- Certified “buddy” statements or affidavits from fellow service members who witnessed your injury or illness
-	Military accident and police reports
-	Examination reports related to employment or insurance

#### Submit your disability compensation claim, NA Form 13055, and any supporting documents 

You can file your claim online, by mail, in person, or with the help of a trained professional. For claims involving the reconstruction of records, we encourage you to work with a professional, such as an accredited attorney, claims agent, or Veterans Service Officer (VSO).
