## How we determine if you're eligible for protected rates

To qualify for protected rates, your yearly income for 2019 must be at or below a certain amount. This is called the income limit. We count as income any money you earn in a year, including your salary, investment and retirement payments, and any income from your dependents. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (paid medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may work in your favor to reduce your countable income.

**We base your income limit on:**
- The specific pension benefits you're eligible to receive (including added amounts for Aid and Attendance), **and**
- Whether or not you have eligible dependents, **and**
- Your yearly income 

### Eligible dependents

Eligible dependents may include your spouse. We recognize same-sex and common-law marriages.

Dependents may also include any biological, step, or adopted children you may have who are unmarried and meet at least one of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true for a dependent child. The child is unmarried and:**
- Is under 18 years old, **or**
- Is between 18 and 23 years old and enrolled in a qualifying school full time, **or**
- Was seriously disabled before age 18 and is unable to care for themselves
