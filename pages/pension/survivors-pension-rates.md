<div class="va-introtext">

If you qualify for survivors pension benefits, the amount you get will be based on the difference between your countable income and a limit that Congress sets (called the Maximum Annual Pension Rate, or MAPR).

</div>

- **Your countable income** is how much you earn, including your salary, investment and retirement payments, and any income you may have from your dependents. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (paid medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may reduce your countable income.

- **Your MAPR amount** is the maximum amount of pension payable to a Veteran, surviving spouse, or child. Your MAPR is based on how many dependents you have and whether you qualify for Housebound or Aid and Attendance benefits. MAPRs are adjusted each year for cost-of-living increases. You can find your current MAPR amount using the tables below.

**Example:**
You’re a qualified surviving spouse with 1 dependent child. You also qualify for Aid and Attendance benefits. Your yearly income is $10,000.

Your MAPR amount = $16,837 <br>
Your yearly income = $10,000 <br>
Your VA pension = $6,837 for the year (or $569 paid each month)


## What's the net worth limit to qualify for a Survivors Pension?

The 2018 net worth limit to qualify for a Survivors Pension is $127,061. We've recently changed the way we determine this rate to make the decision process simpler and more fair for all survivors seeking pension benefits. 

**Note:** In the future, the net worth limit will increase by the same percentage as Social Security cost-of-living increases. We'll update the limit here when there's an increase.

## What's a transfer penalty?

A transfer penalty is a period of time when a survivor isn't eligible for pension benefits because of the way they transferred assets. We'll apply this penalty only if you transfer assets in the 3 years before you apply for a Survivors Pension—and the transfer lowers your net worth enough for you to qualify for pension benefits. The current penalty period rate is $2,230. This dollar amount is used to determine the transfer penalty.
