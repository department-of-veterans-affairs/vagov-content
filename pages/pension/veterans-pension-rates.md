View current VA pension rates for Veterans, including VA Aid and Attendance rates. If you qualify for these benefits, we'll base your payment amount on the difference between your countable income and a limit that Congress sets (called the Maximum Annual Pension Rate, or MAPR).

</div>

- **Your countable income** is how much you earn, including your Social Security benefits, investment and retirement payments, and any income your dependents receive. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may reduce your countable income.

- **Your MAPR amount** is the maximum amount of pension payable. Your MAPR is based on how many dependents you have, if you’re married to another Veteran who qualifies for a pension, and if your disabilities qualify you for Housebound or Aid and Attendance benefits. MAPRs are adjusted each year for cost-of-living increases. You can find your current MAPR amount using the tables below.

**Example:**
You’re a qualified Veteran with a dependent, non-Veteran spouse and no children. You also qualify for Aid and Attendance benefits based on your disabilities. You and your spouse have a combined yearly income of $10,000.
<br>
Your MAPR amount = $26,766 <br>
Your yearly income = $10,000 <br>
Your VA pension = $16,766 for the year (or $1,397 paid each month)

## What's the net worth limit to qualify for a Veterans Pension?

We've recently changed the way we assess net worth to make the pension entitlement rules more clear. Net worth is the total of your or your beneficiary’s assets and annual income. Your net worth also includes the net worth of your spouse. You should report all of your net worth. The net worth limit to qualify for a Veterans Pension as of December 1, 2018, is $127,061.

**Note:** In the future, the net worth limit will increase by the same percentage as Social Security cost-of-living increases. We'll update the limit here when there's an increase.

## What’s the 3-year look-back period for asset transfers?

When we receive a pension claim, we review the terms and conditions of any assets the Veteran may have transferred in the 3 years before filing the claim.

If you transfer assets for less than fair market value during the look-back period, and those assets would have pushed your net worth above the limit for a VA pension, you may be subject to a penalty period of up to 5 years. You won't be eligible for pension benefits during this time.

**Note:** This new policy took effect on October 18, 2018. If you filed your claim before this date, the look-back period doesn't apply. (A look-back period never includes a date before October 18, 2018.)

## What’s a penalty period?

A penalty period is a length of time when a Veteran isn’t eligible for pension benefits because they transferred assets for less than fair market value during the look-back period. We won’t pay pension benefits during a penalty period.
