<div class="va-introtext">

If you qualify for Veterans pension benefits, the amount you get will be based on the difference between your countable income and a limit that Congress sets (called the Maximum Annual Pension Rate, or MAPR).

</div>

- **Your countable income** is how much you earn, including your Social Security benefits, investment and retirement payments, and any income your dependents receive. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may reduce your countable income.

- **Your MAPR amount** is the maximum amount of pension payable. Your MAPR is based on how many dependents you have, if you’re married to another Veteran who qualifies for a pension, and if your disabilities qualify you for Housebound or Aid and Attendance benefits. MAPRs are adjusted each year for cost-of-living increases. You can find your current MAPR amount using the tables below.

**Example:**
You’re a qualified Veteran with a dependent, non-Veteran spouse and no children. You also qualify for Aid and Attendance benefits based on your disabilities. You and your spouse have a combined yearly income of $10,000.
<br>
Your MAPR amount = $26,036 <br>
Your yearly income = $10,000 <br>
Your VA pension = $16,036 for the year (or $1,336 paid each month)

## What's the net worth limit to qualify for a Veterans Pension?

The 2018 net worth limit to qualify for a Veterans Pension is $127,061. We've recently changed the way we determine this rate to make the decision process simpler and more fair for all Veterans. 

**Note:** In the future, the net worth limit will increase by the same percentage as Social Security cost-of-living increases. We'll update the limit here when there's an increase.

## What's a transfer penalty?

A transfer penalty is a period of time when you aren't eligibile for a Veterans Pension. This temporary loss of pension benefits happens only if you transfer assets that make your net worth greater than the VA net worth limit for a Veterans Pension. The current penalty period rate is $2,230. This dollar amount is used to determine the transfer penalty.
