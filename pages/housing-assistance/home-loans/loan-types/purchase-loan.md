## Why might I want a VA-backed purchase loan?

### A VA-backed purchase loan often offers:

- **No down payment** as long as the sales price isn’t higher than the home’s appraised value (the value set for the home after an expert reviews the property)
- **Better terms and interest rates** than other loans from private banks, mortgage companies, or credit unions (also called lenders)
- **The ability to borrow up to the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac conforming loan limit** on a no-down-payment loan in most areas—and more in some high-cost counties. You can borrow more than this amount if you want to make a down payment. <br>

- **No need for private mortgage insurance (PMI) or mortgage insurance premiums (MIP)**
  - PMI is a type of insurance that protects the lender if you end up not being able to pay your mortgage. It’s usually required on conventional loans if you make a down payment of less than 20% of the total mortgage amount.
  - MIP is what the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) requires you to pay to self-insure an FHA loan against future loss.
- **Fewer closing costs**, which may be paid by the seller
- **No penalty fee** if you pay the loan off early

### If you qualify for a VA-backed purchase loan, you can use the loan to:

-	Buy a single-family home, up to 4 units
- Buy a condo in a VA-approved project
-	Buy a home and improve it
-	Buy a manufactured home or lot
-	Build a new home
-	Make changes or add new features (like solar power) to make your home more energy efficient

### You can also:

- Get a VA-backed home loan to buy your first home
- Use your VA loan benefit again if you sell or refinance a home you bought with a VA-backed home loan
- Assume a VA-backed home loan (which means that instead of opening a new mortgage loan, the buyer takes over the seller’s loan)


## How can I buy a home with a VA-backed purchase loan?

## Will I have to pay any fees with my loan?

You may need to pay the VA funding fee. This one-time fee helps to lower the cost of the loan for U.S. taxpayers since the VA home loan program doesn’t require down payments or monthly mortgage insurance. Your lender will also charge interest on the loan in addition to closing fees. <br>
